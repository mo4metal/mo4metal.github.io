## What is the question that you are going to answer?

The question I am going to answer is "What can we find out from the run of the tv show Community?"


## Why is this an important question?

This question is important as:

(1) Community has a legacy of being a [cult classic](https://medium.com/cinemania/how-community-elevated-modern-sitcoms-dc0731b19cf0) television show. According to IMDb, user ratings influence viewer choices and perceptions of TV shows, making it crucial to analyze how "Community" is perceived across its seasons to gauge its overall impact and success. 

(2) According to [Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/community-genre-parodies-ranked/), Community often experimented with genres and was not like other sitcoms airing at the time. Charting the show's success can help promote new and interesting sitcoms in our current time period.

(3) Finally, many established directors such as [Joe and Anthony Russo](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/russo-brothers-community-prepared-us-for-marvel/) made their mark in Community episodes. Charting the series's directors could allow us to understand more about the series's popularity. 


## Which rows and columns of the dataset will be used to answer this question?

I will be using [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bcruise/community-episodes-data/data?select=community_imdb.csv) and will use the columns "title", "directed_by", "us_viewers", "imdb_rating" and "total_votes". 

For challenges, I think one that I am facing right now is merging both csvs available into one. I also need to think of how best to produce a data story with a limited number of columns and observations. I only have imdb ratings and viewership to rely on, so that will be a challenge.
