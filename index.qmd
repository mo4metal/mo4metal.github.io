# NBC's "Community" Data Analysis

## Community (2009-2014)

Community was an American sitcom produced by NBC that ran from 2009 to 2014. It had a historically rocky start, middle and end, with show runner Dan Harmon being fired midway during the show, before being brought back for the show's 5th and 6th seasons.

## Data Analysis

Community frequently experimented with genre and often utilised its sitcom format to parody existing sitcom tropes. This led it to become a cult classic amongst fans who were frequently exposed to and aware of such tropes, but it meant that Community did not do well with the masses.

Thus, I plan to explore the trends within Community's rise and fall, with an analysis of each episode's IMDb ratings. I will also look at categories such as directors and even episode titles. Since Community ran for 6 seasons and 110 episodes, it makes for quite a detailed and interesting analysis.

## Dataset

I will be using [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bcruise/community-episodes-data/data) uploaded by Bill Cruise, which was updated 2 years ago.
