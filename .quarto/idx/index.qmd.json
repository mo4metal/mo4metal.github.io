It had a historically rocky start, middle and end, with show runner Dan Harmon being fired midway during the show, before being brought back for the show's 5th and 6th seasons.\n\n## Data Analysis\n\nCommunity frequently experimented with genre and often utilised its sitcom format to parody existing sitcom tropes. This led it to become a cult classic amongst fans who were frequently exposed to and aware of such tropes, but it meant that Community did not do well with the masses.\n\nThus, I plan to explore the trends within Community's rise and fall, with an analysis of each episode's IMDb ratings. I will also look at categories such as directors and even episode titles. Since Community ran for 6 seasons and 110 episodes, it makes for quite a detailed and interesting analysis.\n\n## Dataset\n\nI will be using [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bcruise/community-episodes-data/data) uploaded by Bill Cruise, which was updated 2 years ago.\n\n## Sample Shiny App\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"400\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://mo4metal.shinyapps.io/sampleappnm2207/\"> </iframe>\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# NBC's \"Community\" Data Analysis\n\n## Community (2009-2014)\n\nCommunity was an American sitcom produced by NBC that ran from 2009 to 2014.
