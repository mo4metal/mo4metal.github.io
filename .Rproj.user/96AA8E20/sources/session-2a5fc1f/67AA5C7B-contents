# Week 8 Project Submission

## What is the topic you have finalised?

I have chosen to do an analysis of the episodes of NBC's Community. I plan to explore the trends within Community's rise and fall, with an analysis of each episode's IMDb ratings. I will also look at categories such as directors and even episode titles. Since Community ran for 6 seasons and 110 episodes, it makes for quite a detailed and interesting analysis.  

## What are the data sources you have curated so far?

I will be using [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bcruise/community-episodes-data/data) uploaded by Bill Cruise on Kaggle, which was updated 2 years ago.
