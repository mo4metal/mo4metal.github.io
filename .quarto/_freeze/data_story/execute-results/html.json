This can be argued to increase a feeling of relatability for viewers who have attended / are familiar with such modules. Such episodes also become more interesting and easily recognisable. \n\n## IMDb Ratings for Community episodes (all seasons)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_story_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## IMDB Ratings Per Season\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"400\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://mo4metal.shinyapps.io/imdb_rating_per_season/\"> </iframe>\n```\n\n\n\n## Mean IMDB Ratings per Season\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_story_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom this bar chart, we can see that Community has had a fairly successful run so far. The IMDB ratings of each season is fairly consistent, ranging from 7.4 to 8.6. Seasons 2 and 3 have the highest mean IMDB ratings, and this could be attributed to the notion that Community had finally found its footing after its first season. Seasons 2 and 3 also have many special episodes, such as episode 6 of season 2, \"Epidemiology\", which has an IMDB rating of 9.3. This particular episode was a parody of a zombie movie, and it was also the season's Halloween episode. Hence, such special episodes can be attributed to the seasons' higher IMDB ratings.\n\nNotably, Season 4 has the lowest mean IMDB rating, at 7.4. This can be attributed to the fact that show runner Dan Harmon was let go from the show after Season 3. This season is often called the [\"Gas Leak Season\"](https://screenrant.com/community-season-4-gas-leak-year-explained/), and it features what fans consider to be writing that was not on par with the rest of the show. The loss of the person who arguably best understood the show thus lead to a drop in quality. After season 4 ended, Dan Harmon was brought back for Season 5, which explains the higher mean IMDB rating, 8.4.\n\nFinally, the last season also has a lower mean IMDB rating. This could be due to the fact that by this season, many once beloved characters such as Troy (Donald Glover) and Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) had left the show. Hence, such departures from the show impacted the fan base's perceptions of the episodes in Season 6, leading to a lower mean IMDB score.\n\n## IMDB Ratings Against Viewership\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"400\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://mo4metal.shinyapps.io/imdb_viewership/\"> </iframe>\n```\n\n\nInterestingly, there does not seem to be a positive relationship between IMDB ratings and Viewership numbers. This means that popular episodes and fan-favourite episodes are not correlated. \n\n## Viewership Trends Over the Seasons\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_story_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nViewership truly faltered, slowing down over the seasons. This could be attributed to the fact that Community often did parody and special episodes, which require a prior knowledge of what was being parodied. Such episodes increased over the run of the show, solidfying Community's standing as a show that was meant for people who were huge sitcom buffs, but this unfortunately alienated casual viewers. \n\nUnfortunately, because Community was acquired by the now defunct streaming website, Yahoo! Screen, it was not aired on network television. Hence, there is no details on the number of viewers that Community had in its sixth season. \n\nUltimately, Community's declining trend in viewership could mean that the unique episodes of Community did badly with a wider audience. This could substantiate the idea that many viewers preferred a more causal, relaxed viewing, and did not want to follow the show's intricate and detailed parodies and plots. \n\nHowever, this reduction of viewers could solidify the show's cult classic status. Community still has a very dedicated fan base despite it being a decade after the show's last season. Perhaps a lower viewership could create a sense of uniqueness amongst viewers, as they could view having watched Community to be a niche interest. Greater bonds between viewers could be formed this way.\n\n## Viewership Trends Per Season\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"400\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://mo4metal.shinyapps.io/viewership_per_season/\"> </iframe>\n```\n\n\n## Mean IMDB Rating by Director\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_story_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
